<p class=Body>A security feature. The rights granted (or denied, in exceptional 
 cases) to users or groups that allow team members to see, modify, create, 
 and delete items.</p>

<h3>adding files</h3>

<p class=Body>Process of placing files under version control by adding 
 them to a project view.</p>

<h3>administrator</h3>

<p class=Body>A functional role in the operation of the application. Project 
 administrators create and/or import projects, manage server configurations, 
 users and groups, and so on.</p>

<h3>All Descendants</h3>

<p class=Body>Button at the top of the right pane. If selected, it allows 
 you to see all items in a particular folder all of its child folders; 
 if cleared, it allows you to see only those items in the folder.</p>

<h3>alphanumeric</h3>

<p class=Body>A value that consists of the letters A-Z and the digits 0-9.</p>

<h3>alternate working folder</h3>

<p class=Body>Allows you to store project files on your workstation at 
 a specific location you have selected. Using an alternate working folder 
 for the root of a view or a branch in an application folder hierarchy 
 can also alter the path of the working folders used for child folders.</p>

<h3 class=Body>application file</h3>

<p class=Body>A file under version control; therefore, a file that is in 
 an application project.</p>

<h3>application folder</h3>

<p class=Body>A folder in the application folder hierarchy. Application 
 folders help organize the project view into discrete understandable parts. 
 Each folder has a working folder that corresponds to it and exists on 
 your hard drive. </p>

<h3>application folder hierarchy</h3>

<p class=Body>The hierarchy of folders as it appears in the project view 
 within an application client. When you map a view and use the folder hierarchy, 
 the folder structure on the virtual disk matches the folder structure 
 you see in the application. This may or may not match the working folder 
 structure on your workstation.</p>

<h3>archive</h3>

<p class=Body>File or group of files that makes it possible to recreate 
 past revisions of a file under version control. An archive can also be, 
 as in the application, the folder that stores such files. </p>

<h3 class=Body>area chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart of the area under a line; used to show the relative 
 importance or proportions of parts to a whole. Depending on the options 
 set, you can display the area with values, area lines, stacked, or in 
 a cluster.</p>

<h3>area line</h3>

<p class=Body>Line on an area chart that is perpendicular to the x-axis 
 and connects the axis to one of the points.</p>

 actions performed on folders and items, such as files and change requests.</p>

<h3>author</h3>

<p class=Body>Person who created a revision.</p>

<h3>automatic refresh</h3>

<p class=Body>An automatic update feature of the application. Since projects, 
 folders, and items managed by the application are subject to continuous 
 revision by various team members, screen information can quickly become 
 outdated. This function periodically reads the project database to update 
 the displayed information.</p>

<h3>axis</h3>

<p class=Body>One of the reference lines in a coordinate system.</p>

<h3>axis area</h3>

<p class=Body>Rectangular area delineated by the x-axis and y-axis shown 
 in the chart.</p>

<h3 class=Body>bar chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that shows a row of vertical or horizontal bars, each 
 of which represents a value; used to show variation over time. Depending 
 on the options set, you can display the bars abutting, with space between 
 them, with borders, with values, and with up to 16 vertices. The bars 
 may be conical-shaped, cylindrical-shaped, or stacked. Vertical bar charts 
 can be in a cluster.</p>

<h3>binary file</h3>

<p class=Body>Any file that is not strictly an ASCII text file. Binary 
 files contain programs or data in machine code.</p>

<h3>blank branching view</h3>

<p class=Body>An empty branching view. It has no correlation to the parent 
 view. Also called non-derived view.</p>

<h3>branch</h3>

<p class=Body>An independent item derived from a corresponding item in 
 a parent view. In the case of a text file, the branched item can later 
 be merged with the file from which it originated. This term also refers 
 to a branch of a tree, such as the folder hierarchy or a topic tree.</p>

<h3>branch revision </h3>

<p class=Body>A number is assigned by the application to a revision of 
 an item. It indicates how many consecutive revisions have been made in 
 a view; it branches when the item is branched into a new view. </p>

<h3>branching view</h3>

<p class=Body>A view that may or may not be derived from a parent view. 
 When not derived from a parent view, it is a blank branching view. Branching 
 views always permit branching. If they float and have the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Branch 
 on change</B></span> option set, they are updated by the parent view on a 
 file-by-file basis until the file changes in the branching view. If they 
 float and do not have the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Branch on change</B></span> 
 option set, updates are sent to the parent view until the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Branch 
 on change</B></span> option is set. If they are based on a label, a promotion 
 state, or a moment in time, they are read-only, unless the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Branch 
 on change</B></span> option is set.</p>

<h3>build</h3>

<p class=Body>The process of compiling, assembling, and linking all project 
 files in proper sequence to produce a software product. Also an event 
 in the life cycle of a product chosen to represent a quantifiable step

 can be compressed to reduce the amount of traffic on the network. However, 
 the time to compress and decompress the data is added to the transfer 
 time.</p>

<h3>configuration</h3>

<p class=Body>A relative arrangement of parts or elements. An application 
 configuration isolates a view, folder, or item to a particular revision. 
 For example, you can configure a view to be current or based on a view 
 label, a promotion state, or a selected date and time.</p>

 and maintaining a history of their identification and eventual resolution.</p>

<h3>delete</h3>

<p class=Body>To remove information from application databases. You can 
 delete items within a project or working files. Items deleted from a project 
 can become visible again by rolling back the view, parent folder, or item 
 itself to a time prior to the deletion. Deleted working files cannot be 
 restored by the application.</p>

<h3>delta storage</h3>

 used. For the TCP/IP (sockets) protocol, the endpoint is a port number.</p>

<h3>exclusive lock</h3>

<p class=Body>An exclusive lock indicates to others that you intend to make changes 
  on an item. For a file, the icon others see is yellow padlock, while you see 
  an icon with a small yellow key and the head and shoulders of a person. Other 
  people cannot check in an item that you have exclusively locked.</p>

<h3>explode</h3>

<p class=Body>A pie or doughnut slice is said to explode when you drag 
 it away from the rest of the slices.</p>

<h3>file compression</h3>

<p class=Body>Technique for reducing the size of a file by removing redundant 
 information. Most disk files contain repetitions of common sequences of 
 characters. Compression algorithms remove the additional occurrences of 
 these sequences and save the information that permits their restoration. 
 Selecting file compression may reduce vault space requirements, as well 
 as improve performance.</p>

<h3>File list</h3>

<p class=Body>The list of files for the folder selected from the application 
 folder hierarchy; this list displays on the upper pane when you select 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>File</B></span> tab. It can be further 
 refined by queries, filters, etc.</p>

<h3>filter</h3>

<p class=Body>Criteria used to select a few items from among many. The 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Filter</B></span> drop-down list box allows 
 you to display only the items that are of interest. Applying a filter 
 may also control what columns are displayed, what columns are sorted, 
 and how the values are grouped in the sorted columns.</p>

<h3>fixed change request</h3>

<p class=Body>Designation indicating that a change request has been resolved.</p>

<h3>float</h3>

<p class=Body>For views, a floating view is one that stays current with 
 its parent view. In other words, updates to the parent view are sent to 
 the child view. If the child is not read-only, updates to the child view 
 also go to the parent.</p>

<p class=Body>For charts, this term refers to an item that is in its own 
 window. A floating toolbar can be moved to any location on the screen.</p>

<h3>folder hierarchy</h3>

<p class=Body>Hierarchical display of an application view and its associated 
 folders. The folder hierarchy is always displayed in the left pane of 
 the view window.</p>

<h3>frozen</h3>

<p class=Body>An item is said to be frozen (and, therefore, read-only) 
 if it is based on the state of the corresponding item in the parent view 
 at a specific moment in time <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>and</B></span> 
 cannot be branched. An item is also frozen if you reconfigure it to a 
 specific label, promotion state, or time in its past.</p>

<h3>full revision storage</h3>

<p class=Body>A storage method in which all revisions of a file are saved 
 in their entirety. In StarTeam 6.0 and earlier releases, choosing this 
 storage method eliminated the processing times necessary to reconstruct 
 complex binary files stored in delta format.</p>

<h3>hi-low-close chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that shows three series of columns, each representing 
 the high, low, or closing prices of a stock; used in financial analysis. 
 Depending on the options set, you can display the elements as bars or 
 with or without values. Bars can be displayed with borders, with up to 
 16 vertices, or with a conical or cylindrical shape.</p>

<h3>History list</h3>

<p class=Body>List of revisions for the file selected from the File list 
 in the upper pane. The application displays the History list when you 
 select the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>History</B></span> tab from the 
 lower pane.</p>

<h3>item</h3>

<p class=Body>The application object or element. Items include files, change 
 requests, requirements, tasks, topics, responses, and audit entries. A 
 folder is often treated an item, even though it is a container for items.</p>

<h3>keyword</h3>

<p class=Body>Reserved words beginning and ending with a dollar sign ($). 
 When used in a text file, the application replaces these words with the 
 data that they represent. For example $Author$ is replaced by the name 
 of the user who checked in the file.</p>

<h3>keyword expansion</h3>

<p class=Body>A technique used to insert information in a text file. Keywords 
 are replaced by the data they represent. </p>

<h3>label</h3>

<p class=Body>In version control, the act of attaching a view or revision 
 label (name) to one or more folders and/or items. </p>

<p class=Body>In a chart, the text that identifies points along an axis. 
 The label also appears in the legend unless the legend is a series legend.</p>

<h3>labeled configuration</h3>

<p class=Body>The basis for a new or reconfigured view. The view contains 
 only the items with the label you specify. </p>

<h3>legend</h3>

<p class=Body>Key to a chart. The legend shows the colors or patterns used 
 to identify elements of a chart, along with the text that identifies that 
 element. The legend appears in its own section of the chart window or 
 in another window.</p>

<h3>line chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that shows a line of connected points; used to show 
 trends or changes in data over time. Depending on the options set, you 
 can display the lines alone, with point markers, with values, or in a 
 cluster.</p>

<h3>link</h3>

<p class=Body>Method of connecting any two folders, items, or a folder 
 and an item. If you select an item, the application provides a<span style="font-weight: bold;"><B> 
 Link</B></span> tab that shows all other items to which it is linked.</p>

<h3>lock</h3>

<p class=Body>File locking is a technique used to inform others that you 
 are revising a file (exclusive lock) or considering its revision (non-exclusive 
 lock). Checking files out or in does not imply automatic locking or unlocking 
 in the application, as these operations can be performed manually. Locks 
 can also be overridden and broken. </p>

<h3>MAPI</h3>

<p class=Body>Acronym for Mail Application Programming Interface, a programming 
 interface that permits an application to send and receive electronic mail 
 via the Microsoft Mail messaging system. The application uses SMTP and 
 not MAPI.</p>

<h3>Merge</h3>

<p class=Body>File status that indicates that the working file is not based 
 on the tip revision of the file. When you check this file in or out, the 
 application asks if you want to merge it with the tip revision.</p>

<h3>merge</h3>

<p class=Body>Process of combining a working file with the tip revision 
 of that file or combining a branched file with the original file from 
 which it was branched. This operation involves a three-way comparison, 
 in which both files are compared with the file revision that is their 
 most recent common ancestor. The combined file can be inspected or revised 
 by the user before it is checked in.</p>

<h3>milestone</h3>

<p class=Body>An event in the life cycle of a product that represents a 
 significant step in its progress, for example, its final release. In the 
 application, when you reach a milestone, you can apply a view label (usually 
 a build label) to indicate that the milestone has been reached. </p>

<p class=Body>In Microsoft Project, a milestone is a type of task that 
 represents a significant landmark, development, or turning point in the 
 life of a scheduled project. You usually define a milestone by entering 
 a task name and assigning it a duration of zero. Milestones typically 
 signal that the work has started or is completed and do not represent 
 the act of doing of the work.</p>

<h3>Missing</h3>

<p class=Body>File status indicating that the file is not in your working 
 folder. You may want to check the file out. </p>

<h3>Modified</h3>

<p class=Body>File status indicating that the working file has been altered 
 and is based on the tip revision of this file. You may want to check this 
 file in.</p>

<h3>non-exclusive lock</h3>

<p class=Body>A lock that notifies others that you are considering changing 
 the file. When you have a file locked non-exclusively, others can check 
 the file in. With text files, it is not unusual for several people to 
 modify a file simultaneously and rely on Visual Merge to manage the changes. 
 In such cases, non-exclusive locks help you to identify those people whose 
 input is required to resolve any conflicts.</p>

<h3>Not In View</h3>

<p class=Body>File status that indicates the file is in the working folder, 
 but not in the application view. You may want to add this file to the 
 view. </p>

<h3>notification of events</h3>

<p class=Body>If this feature is enabled, the application notifies that 
 you have become responsible for a change request, that a requirement or 
 task for which you are responsible has changed, or that a topic for which 
 you are a recipient has changed. The notification appears as an appropriate 
 icon on the status bar.</p>

<h3>object</h3>

<p class=Body>Generic term used in object-oriented programming and elsewhere 
 to indicate something upon which operations can be performed. </p>

<h3>open-hi-low-close chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that shows four series of columns, each representing 
 the open, high, low, or closing prices of a stock; used in financial analysis.</p>

<h3>Out Of Date</h3>

<p class=Body>File status indicating that your working file is a copy of 
 an old revision of the file. If you need the current revision, check it 
 out.</p>

<h3>owner</h3>

<p class=Body>Term referring to the person who created or added an item 
 to the application or who checked in a revision.</p>

<h3 class=Body>Palette Bar</h3>

<p class=Body>Bar at top of the chart window from which colors can be dragged 
 to change chart elements. You cannot use the Palette Bar to change text 
 color, which is a font option.</p>

<h3>pane</h3>

<p class=Body>The application’s project view window is divided into three 
 panes. The left pane displays the hierarchy of folders in the current 
 view of the project. The right upper pane lists the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>File</B></span>, 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Change Request</B></span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Requirement</B></span>, 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Task</B></span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Topic</B></span>, 
 and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Audit</B></span> tabs, and the right 
 lower pane displays Detail, History, Label, Link or Reference information 
 corresponding to the selected item on the upper right pane.</p>

<h3>Pareto chart</h3>

<p class=Body>A bar chart that has an added curve indicating the proportion 
 accumulated by each bar in the chart; used in statistical analysis. Depending 
 on the options set, you can display lines with point markers and or values. 
 </p>

<h3>pattern bar</h3>

<p class=Body>Bar at top of chart window that allows a pattern to be dragged 
 to a chart element, such as a bar, slice, axis area, chart background, 
 or point markers in a series.</p>

<h3>Pattern Editor</h3>

<p class=Body>Editor used to change the repeating bitmap used as a pattern.</p>

<h3>personal options</h3>

<p class=Body>User-selectable choices for the behavior of the application 
 on a specific workstation.</p>

<h3 class=Body>pie chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Circular chart containing slices that represent proportions 
 of a whole. You can display one or more slice exploded (i.e., moved away 
 from the center). Pie charts can be rotated around the x-axis only.</p>

<h3>point chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that plots points or point markers: used to show trends 
 or changes in data over time. Depending on the options set, you can display 
 the points alone, connected by lines, with point markers, with values, 
 or in a cluster.</p>

<h3>point marker</h3>

<p class=Body>Location of a point represented as a triangle, circle, etc.</p>

<h3>polar chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that shows a polar coordinate system; used to show 
 the relative importance of values over time. Depending on the options 
 set, you can display points with point markers or with values.</p>

<h3>pooled connections</h3>

<p class=Body>Concurrent connections that the server opens to the database 
 engine. The range is usually database-specific and may also depend upon 
 the number of database licenses.</p>

<h3>project</h3>

<p class=Body>Set of related folders and their contents that usually represents 
 a single product under application version control.</p>

<h3>promotion state</h3>

<p class=Body>A state through which a product passes. For example, a software

 can apply a query to items in the upper pane to display only the items 
 of interest</p>

<h3>read-only reference view</h3>

<p class=Body>A reference view is a view that either cannot be changed 
 at all or changes only when its parent view changes. If it floats, it 
 is updated as its parent changes. If it is based on a label and the items 
 with the specified label change in the parent view, the read-only reference 
 view reflects that fact. If it is based on a specific date and time, it 
 is frozen, to show what the parent view looked like at that point in time 
 and cannot be rolled back.</p>

<h3>real-time chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that can receive data and scroll automatically without 
 flickering; suitable for specific real-time applications.</p>

<h3 class=Body>reconfiguring</h3>

 a file may be shared by two projects on the same server and, therefore, 
 have two references to it.</p>

<h3>reference view</h3>

<p class=Body>A view derived from a parent view. It generally uses a different 
 folder as a root folder and the same working folders as those of its parent. 
 If it floats, it receives updates as the parent view changes. If it floats 
 and is not read-only, it sends updates to the parent view as it changes. 
 If the reference view is based a specific label or date and time within 
 the parent view, it is frozen at that moment in time and is read-only.</p>

<h3>refresh</h3>

<p class=Body>The updating of the information in the project view window 
 or only its upper pane. Press<span style="font-weight: bold;"><B> Shift + 
 F5</B></span> to refresh information about the current application view. Press<span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B> F5</B></span> to update only the data in the upper 
 pane, such as the files list or change requests list. Press <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Ctrl 
 + F5</B></span> to update the data and simultaneously collapse all the displayed 
 groups or trees. Press <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>F6 </B></span>to refresh 
 foreign files (files in PVCS or SourceSafe projects).</p>

<h3>repository</h3>

<p class=Body>The database and hive associated with a particular server 
 configuration. Each hive contains an Archives and a Cache folder for file 
 storage.</p>

<h3>repository customization</h3>

<p class=Body>The application feature that allows you to modify values 
 of existing enumerated fields and create customized fields for items to 
 represent information specific to your working environment. Your license 
 determines whether you have this feature.</p>

<h3>Requirement component</h3>

<p class=Body>The application component that allows users to create, track, 
 and complete requirements related to the project. This component also 
 imports requirements from CaliberRM.</p>

<h3>response</h3>

<p class=Body>Replies to a topic that, along with the topic, form a hierarchical 
 structure called a topic tree.</p>

<h3>revision</h3>

<p class=Body>Set of changes to an item. As an item is revised, each set 
 of changes is saved as a revision. </p>

<h3>revision label</h3>

<p class=Body>Method of identifying a revision of an item or a set of revisions 
 by name; used primarily for files. For example, when you check in a group 
 of files that may need to be checked out together, you can give them a 
 revision label.</p>

<h3>revision number</h3>

<p class=Body>The revision number is an identification number assigned 
 by the application to a revision of an item. It indicates how many consecutive 
 revisions have been made since the item was originally created.</p>

<h3>root folder</h3>

<p class=Body>The top folder in an application folder hierarchy. It has 
 the same name as the view.</p>

<h3>scale</h3>

<p class=Body>The amount that each unit on an axis represents. For example, 
 if the scale is 1/1000, each unit represents 1,000 of whatever the chart 
 measures. A tick mark labeled 5 would be 5,000.</p>

<h3>scatter chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Point chart that shows the relationship or degree of relationship 
 between numeric values in several series. Two groups of numbers may be 
 plotted as one series of x-y coordinates. Depending on the options set 
 for a scatter chart, you can display the points alone, with point markers, 
 with values, or connected by lines. In this type of chart, the attributes 
 assigned to the y-axis become the attributes of the x-axis as well. For 
 example, if the y-axis is blue, so is the x-axis.</p>

<h3>secondary sort</h3>

<p class=Body>Sorting items by group in a list that is already sorted (primary 
 sort). For example a File list might be sorted by extension, then sorted 
 by name within groups of the same extension.</p>

<h3 class=Body>series</h3>

<p class=Body>A simple chart contains only one series: one line, one row 
 of bars, etc. Charts that can have more than one series include: area 
 charts, cubes charts, point charts, vertical bar (or column) charts, line 
 charts, and spline charts. Each series has its own legend, color, etc. 
 In addition, a series legend identifies each series, usually by color. 
 A chart with more than one series is called a multitype chart. Pie and 
 doughnut charts have multiple series so that each slice can be assigned 
 a different color, but only one type. The legend for a pie or doughnut 
 chart is not a series legend.</p>

<h3>series legend</h3>

<p class=Body>A legend identifying each series in a chart with multiple 
 series or types. Each slice in a pie and doughnut chart is defined internally 
 as a series so each slice can have a different color. However, the legend 
 for a pie or doughnut chart is not a series legend.</p>

<h3>server</h3>

<p class=Body>A computer or system that provides services to clients. The 
 clients may be other computers.</p>

<h3>server configuration</h3>

<p class=Body>Contains the repository and option settings selected when 
 you set up the application server. For example, the administrator may 
 want projects to use encryption and compression, so the server configuration 
 specifies these features. The application items, such as folders and files, 
 can be shared provided their projects use the same server configuration. 
 A server can be started with any one of several server configurations, 
 but that configuration controls what projects, etc. can be accessed during 
 that session.</p>

<h3>shortcut</h3>

<p class=Body>A file that starts another application, often with a specific 
 document or set of data. The shortcut is usually stored as an icon on 
 your desktop. </p>

<h3>SMTP</h3>

<p class=Body>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, commonly used for Internet 
 and UNIX mail systems. It usually uses port 25. Sending items via e-mail 
 in the application requires SMTP.</p>

<h3>sort</h3>

<p class=Body>To place items in ascending or descending order in the upper 
 pane of the project view window, based on the value in one column. Depending 
 on the values in the column, values are sorted numerically, alphanumerically, 
 or by an internal order or key. Click the column header to change the 
 sort order from ascending to descending or vice versa. </p>

<h3 class=Body>spline chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that shows a curved line of connected points; used 
 to show trends or changes in data over time. Depending on the options 
 set, you can display lines alone, with point markers, with values, or 
 in a cluster.</p>

<h3 class=Body>stacked</h3>

<p class=Body>When the bar or area for one series starts where the bar 
 or area for another ends, the two series are stacked. 100% stacked means 
 that the entire axis area is filled.</p>

<p class=Body>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>status</h3>

<p class=Body>File status is the relationship between the working file 
 and the tip revision in the repository. The file statuses are: In View, 
 Not in View, Missing, Current, Merge, Modified, Out of Date, and Unknown.</p>

<h3>storage method</h3>

<p class=Body>Revisions stored in the archive (or vault) for a specific 
 file can be changed from one type of storage and compression to another. 
 There are two types of storage: forward delta storage, which is recommended 
 for text files, and full revision storage, which is recommended for binary 
 files and text files that change massively from revision to revision.</p>

<h3>surface chart</h3>

<p class=Body>Chart that looks as a sheet had been stretched over the surface 
 of a 3D bar chart; can be viewed in 2D or 3D. Used to find the best combinations 
 using two sets of data. Colors are assigned depending on the height (y 
 value) of each point in the chart. To display a surface chart, you must 
 have more than one series.</p>

<h3>Task component</h3>

<p class=Body>Users can create, track, and resolve tasks related to their 
 projects with this component if your company has licensed &nbsp;Enterprise 
 Advantage or Enterprise. The component also interoperates with Microsoft 
 Project.</p>

<h3>TCP/IP</h3>

<p class=Body>A protocol for communication between computers used by the 
 Internet; acronym for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.</p>

<h3>test command</h3>

<p class=Body>Command that you enter so that the application can perform 
 an automated procedure to test a defect.</p>

<h3>text file or ASCII file</h3>

<p class=Body>File that contains only printable text characters, spaces, 
 carriage returns, and sometimes tabs and an end-of-file marker, without 
 formatting codes. The application identifies as text files any files that 
 contain no null characters. All other files are binary.</p>

<h3>tick mark</h3>

<p class=Body>Marks along an axis at given intervals. For example, the 
 y-axis may have tick marks at 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. </p>

<h3>time stamp</h3>

<p class=Body>Information maintained by the application about files and 
 revisions. For file revisions, the time stamp is the date and time that 
 the file was checked into the application. For files, it is the date and 
 time for the working file.</p>

<h3>tip revision</h3>

<p class=Body>Most recent revision to an item. The tip revision is based 
 on your view’s configuration. For example, if your view is configured 
 to a particular label, the tip revision is the revision with that label. 
 If your view is configured to a particular date and time, the tip revision 
 is the one that was checked in just prior to that point in time.</p>

<h3>title</h3>

<p class=Body>Informational text that can be placed at the top, bottom, 
 left, or right of the chart window. For example, you may want to insert 
 an over-all title at the top of the chart and names for the x and y-axes 
 at the bottom and left sides of the chart window.</p>

<h3>Title bar</h3>

<p class=Body>Bar that shows the name of the application and, if it is 
 maximized, of the selected child window. For a view, the child window’s 
 name includes both the project name and the view name, followed by the 
 current working folder for the root folder.</p>

<h3>toolbar</h3>

<p class=Body>Bar that contains buttons or icons, each of which performs 
 a variety of functions. Usually located at the top of the screen, but 
 can be dragged to any edge of the window or float in a separate window 
 that can move anywhere on the screen.</p>

<h3>topic</h3>

<p class=Body>First message on a particular subject attached to a folder 
 in the application folder hierarchy. After this message has been submitted 
 by a team member, others may respond to it, creating a topic tree.</p>

<h3>topic tree</h3>

<p class=Body>Topic tree represents a threaded conversation of the topic 
 with its responses and the responses to those responses. </p>

<h3>Unknown</h3>

<p class=Body>File status indicating that a file in the working folder 
 has the same name as a file in the view, but that the file has not been 
 checked out from the repository. You may have copied the file from another 
 location. Use <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Update Status</B></span> to 
 determine the correct status.</p>

<h3>unlock</h3>

<p class=Body>The process of releasing a locked file, indicating to others 
 that you no longer wish to change the file.</p>

<h3>user</h3>

<p class=Body>An individual given access to an application server configuration 
 and the projects it manages. </p>

<h3>value</h3>

<p class=Body>Value or quantity associated with a bar, slice, or point. 
 When displayed, the value appears at the top of a bar, beside a slice, 
 or above a point.</p>

<h3>vault</h3>

<p class=Body>Folder in which revisions of the files that are under version 
 control are stored. </p>

<h3>vault file</h3>

<p class=Body>File in the vault that stores file revisions.</p>

<h3>version control</h3>

<p class=Body>Version control is the process of storing and tracking changes 
 (revisions) to one or more files. The main advantage of using an automated 
 version control system is fast, easy recall of previous revisions. The 
 application also tracks revisions of other items, such as change requests.</p>

<h3>version control system</h3>

<p class=Body>Application software that permits you to manage multiple 
 revisions of the same file. It maintains the revision history that is 
 generated as files evolve into their final forms.</p>

<h3>view</h3>

<p class=Body>A view consists of an application folder hierarchy and the 
 items associated with each folder in that hierarchy. The name of a project 
 and its root view are often identical. A view may or may not permit branching, 
 be read only, or have a connection to its parent view.</p>

<h3>view label</h3>

<p class=Body>Serves as a time stamp for the entire contents of a view. 
 Having a view label allows you to roll back a view to that label and see 
 everything that existed at that point in time. Unless the view label is 
 frozen, you can adjust it by attaching or detaching it from items. You 
 can also move a view label from one revision to another. </p>

<h3>Visual Diff</h3>

<p class=Body>An application utility that allows you to compare two text 
 files or two revisions of one text file and see the differences between 
 them.</p>

<h3>Visual Merge</h3>

<p class=Body>An application utility that allows you to merge two revisions 
 of a file that are based on the same checked-in revision.</p>

<h3>work around</h3>

<p class=Body>Steps users must take to avoid a problem in the product. 
 Work arounds are frequently offered until the resolution of a defect becomes 
 available.</p>

<h3>working file</h3>

<p class=Body>Any file in a working folder can be considered a working 
 file. Often, these files have been checked out for modification. When 
 checked in, a working file becomes a revision.</p>
