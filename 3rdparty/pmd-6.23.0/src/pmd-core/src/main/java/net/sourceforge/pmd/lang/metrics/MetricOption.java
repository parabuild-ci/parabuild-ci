 * Option to pass to a metric. Options modify the behaviour of a metric. You must bundle them into a

 * <p>Combining options together may be done with a decorator pattern. If you use an AST visitor to compute your
 * metric, look at the Cyclo metric in the Java framework for an example (the decorator pattern is not applicable as
 * is on a visitor, a modified version of it has been implemented for the Java framework).
