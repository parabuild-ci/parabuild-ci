## Overview

Duplicate code can be hard to find, especially in a large project.
But PMD's **Copy/Paste Detector (CPD)** can find it for you!

CPD works with Java, JSP, C/C++, C#, Go, Kotlin, Ruby, Swift and [many more languages](#supported-languages).
It can be used via [command-line](#cli-usage), or via an [Ant task](#ant-task).
It can also be run with Maven by using the `cpd-check` goal on the [Maven PMD Plugin](pmd_userdocs_tools_maven.html).


Your own language is missing?
See how to add it [here](pmd_devdocs_major_adding_new_cpd_language.html).


### Why should you care about duplicates?

It's certainly important to know where to get CPD, and how to call it, but it's worth stepping back for a moment and asking yourself why you should care about this, being the occurrence of duplicate code blocks.

Assuming duplicated blocks of code are supposed to do the same thing, any refactoring, even simple, must be duplicated too -- which is unrewarding grunt work, and puts pressure on the developer to find every place in which to perform the refactoring. Automated tools like CPD can help with that to some extent.

However, failure to keep the code in sync may mean automated tools will no longer recognise these blocks as duplicates. This means the task of finding duplicates to keep them in sync when doing subsequent refactorings can no longer be entrusted to an automated tool -- adding more burden on the maintainer. Segments of code initially supposed to do the same thing may grow apart undetected upon further refactoring.

Now, if the code may never change in the future, then this is not a problem.

Otherwise, the most viable solution is to not duplicate. If the duplicates are already there, then they should be refactored out. We thus advise developers to use CPD to **help remove duplicates**, not to help keep duplicates in sync.

### Refactoring duplicates

Once you have located some duplicates, several refactoring strategies may apply depending of the scope and extent of the duplication. Here's a quick summary:

* If the duplication is local to a method or single class:
    * Extract a local variable if the duplicated logic is not prohibitively long
    * Extract the duplicated logic into a private method
* If the duplication occurs in siblings within a class hierarchy:
    * Extract a method and pull it up in the class hierarchy, along with common fields
    * Use the [Template Method](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/template_method) design pattern
* If the duplication occurs consistently in unrelated hierarchies:
    * Introduce a common ancestor to those class hierarchies

Novice as much as advanced readers may want to [read on on Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/smells/duplicate-code) for more in-depth strategies, use cases and explanations.

### Examples

_Note:_ The following example use the Linux start script. For Windows, just replace "./run.sh cpd" by "cpd.bat".


Minimum required options: Just give it the minimum duplicate size and the source directory:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java

You can also specify the language:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /path/to/c/source --language cpp

You may wish to check sources that are stored in different directories:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /path/to/other/source  --files /path/to/other/source --files /path/to/other/source --language fortran

<em>There should be no limit to the number of '--files', you may add... But if you stumble one, please tell us !</em>

And if you're checking a C source tree with duplicate files in different architecture directories
you can skip those using --skip-duplicate-files:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /path/to/c/source --language cpp --skip-duplicate-files

You can also specify the encoding to use when parsing files:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java --encoding utf-16le

You can also specify a report format - here we're using the XML report:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java --format xml

The default format is a text report, and there's also a `csv` report.

Note that CPD is pretty memory-hungry; you may need to give Java more memory to run it, like this:

    $ export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m
    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java

In order to change the heap size under Windows, you'll need to edit the batch file `cpd.bat` or
set the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` prior to starting CPD:

    C:\ > cd C:\pmd-bin-{{site.pmd.version}}\bin
    C:\...\bin > set PMD_JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m
    C:\...\bin > .\cpd.bat --minimum-tokens 100 --files c:\temp\src


If you specify a source directory but don't want to scan the sub-directories, you can use the non-recursive option:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --non-recursive --files /usr/local/java/src/java

### Exit status

Please note that if CPD detects duplicated source code, it will exit with status 4 (since 5.0).
This behavior has been introduced to ease CPD integration into scripts or hooks, such as SVN hooks.

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Everything is fine, no code duplications found</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Couldn't understand command line parameters or CPD exited with an exception</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least one code duplication has been detected unless '--failOnViolation false' is used.</td></tr>

## Ant task

Andy Glover wrote an Ant task for CPD; here's how to use it:

```xml
    <target name="cpd">
        <taskdef name="cpd" classname="net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPDTask" />
        <cpd minimumTokenCount="100" outputFile="/home/tom/cpd.txt">
            <fileset dir="/home/tom/tmp/ant">
                <include name="**/*.java"/>
            </fileset>
        </cpd>
    </target>
```

Also, you can get verbose output from this task by running ant with the `-v` flag; i.e.:

    ant -v -f mybuildfile.xml cpd

Also, you can get an HTML report from CPD by using the XSLT script in pmd/etc/xslt/cpdhtml.xslt.  Just run
the CPD task as usual and right after it invoke the Ant XSLT script like this:

```xml
    <xslt in="cpd.xml" style="etc/xslt/cpdhtml.xslt" out="cpd.html" />
```

## GUI

CPD also comes with a simple GUI. You can start it via some scripts in the `bin` folder:

For Windows:

    cpdgui.bat

For Linux:

    ./run.sh cpdgui

Here's a screenshot of CPD after running on the JDK 8 java.lang package:

## Suppression

Arbitrary blocks of code can be ignored through comments on **Java**, **C/C++**, **Dart**, **Go**, **Javascript**,
**Kotlin**, **Lua**, **Matlab**, **Objective-C**, **PL/SQL**, **Python** and **Swift** by including the keywords `CPD-OFF` and `CPD-ON`.

```java
    public Object someParameterizedFactoryMethod(int x) throws Exception {
        // some unignored code

        // tell cpd to start ignoring code - CPD-OFF

        // mission critical code, manually loop unroll
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);

        // resume CPD analysis - CPD-ON

        // further code will *not* be ignored
    }
```

Additionally, **Java** allows to toggle suppression by adding the annotations
**`@SuppressWarnings("CPD-START")`** and **`@SuppressWarnings("CPD-END")`**
all code within will be ignored by CPD.

This approach however, is limited to the locations were `@SuppressWarnings` is accepted.
It's legacy and the new comment's based approach should be favored.

```java
    //enable suppression
    @SuppressWarnings("CPD-START")
    public Object someParameterizedFactoryMethod(int x) throws Exception {
        // any code here will be ignored for the duplication detection
    }
    //disable suppression
    @SuppressWarnings("CPD-END)
    public void nextMethod() {
    }
```

Other languages currently have no support to suppress CPD reports. In the future,
the comment based approach will be extended to those of them that can support it.

## Credits
CPD has been through three major incarnations:

*   First we wrote it using a variant of Michael Wise's Greedy String Tiling algorithm (our variant is described
    [here](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/03/12/pmd_cpd.html)).

*   Then it was completely rewritten by Brian Ewins using the
    [Burrows-Wheeler transform](http://dogma.net/markn/articles/bwt/bwt.htm).

*   Finally, it was rewritten by Steve Hawkins to use the
    [Karp-Rabin](http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/karpRabin.html) string matching algorithm.
