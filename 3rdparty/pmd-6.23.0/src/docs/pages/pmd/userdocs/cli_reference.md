## Options

The tool comes with a rather extensive help text, simply running with `-help`!

## Additional Java Runtime Options

PMD is executed via a Java runtime. In some cases, you might need to set additional runtime options, e.g.
if you want to analyze a project, that uses one of OpenJDK's [Preview Language Features](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12).

Just set the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` before executing PMD, e.g.

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS="--enable-preview"
    ./run.sh pmd -d ../../../src/main/java/ -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml

## Exit Status

Please note that if PMD detects any violations, it will exit with status 4 (since 5.3).
This behavior has been introduced to ease PMD integration into scripts or hooks, such as SVN hooks.

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Everything is fine, no violations found</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Couldn't understand command-line parameters or PMD exited with an exception</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least one violation has been detected, unless <code>-failOnViolation false</code> is set.</td></tr>
</table>


## Supported Languages

The language is determined automatically by PMD from the file extensions. Some languages such as "Java"
however support multiple versions. The default version will be used, which is usually the latest supported
version. If you want to use an older version, so that e.g. rules, that suggest usage of language features,
that are not available yet, won't be executed, you need to specify a specific version via the `-language`
and `-version` parameter.

These parameters are irrelevant for languages that don't support different versions.

Example:

``` shell
./run.sh pmd -d src/main/java -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -language java -version 8
```
