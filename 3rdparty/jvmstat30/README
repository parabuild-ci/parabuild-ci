                            jvmstat 3.0

Introduction
------------

The jvmstat technology adds light weight performance and configuration
instrumentation to the HotSpot JVM and provides a set of monitoring
APIs and tools for monitoring the performance of the HotSpot JVM in
production environments. The instrumentation is designed such that it
is 'always on', yet has negligible performance impact. The monitoring
interfaces added to the HotSpot JVM are proprietary and may or may not
be supported in future versions of the HotSpot JVM.

The core jvmstat technology has now been included in J2SE 5.0. This
jvmstat 3.0 bundle includes only the visualgc tool and is backwords
compatable with J2SE 1.4.2 and J2SE 1.4.1. Therefore with J2SE 5.0
and this jvmstat 3.0 bundle you can use visualgc to monitor applications
running in either J2SE 5.0, J2SE 1.4.2 or J2SE 1.4.1.


Installation
------------

This distribution of the jvmstat tools requires J2SE 5.0 with the
HotSpot JVM. Before configuring and using the jvmstat tools, first
download and install J2SE 5.0 (1.5.0) for your operating environment.
You must choose the JDK distribution as the class files needed by the
monitoring tools are not included with the JRE.
