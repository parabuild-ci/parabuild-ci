To use mockito either:
   
   - put 'mockito-all-x.jar' on your path (runtime dependencies: Objenesis and Hamcrest-core are expanded into single, 'all' jar)
 
    - or put all jars from 'separate-jars' folder on your path. You need mockito-core, objenesis and hamcrest-core. 
    Instead of hamcrest-core you might use latest junit that includes hamcrest-core in the jar.
 
All jars (even the dependencies) contain java source inside.
However, for convenience of some IDEs there are also source distributions in 'sources' folder

springsource distributions of hamcrest/objenesis are used only because they are OSGI-fied
