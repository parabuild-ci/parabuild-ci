<p>JUnit test-suite that processes FreeMarker templates and compare their
output to reference files.</p>

<p>To add a test-case, go to
<tt>src/test/resources/freemarker/test/templatesuite/</tt> and inside that
directory:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a template to under <tt>templates/</tt> with whatever meaningful
      file name</li>
  <li>Add the expected output to <tt>references/</tt> with exactly the same
      file name</li>
  <li>Add a new <tt>testcase</tt> elemen to <tt>testcases.xml</tt></li>
  <li>If you want to add items to the data-model or do something else special,
      modify the <tt>setUp()</tt> method in
      <tt>src/test/java/freemarker/test/templatesuite/TemplateTestCase.java</tt>
      </li>
</ol>
