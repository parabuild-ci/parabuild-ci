</head>
<body>

<p>A simple test follows:</p>

<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>This is the same message, using the &quot;compress&quot; tag:</p>
<p>Hello, world!</p>
<p>This is the same message, using the &quot;StandardCompress&quot; transform model:</p>
<p>Hello, world!</p>
<p>This multi-line message should be compressed to a single line.</p>

<p>An example where the first character is not whitespace but the second character is:</p>
<p>x y</p>

<p>The end.</p>
