<p>Exposes <a href="http://www.jython.org" target="_blank">Jython</a> objects to templates.
The {@link freemarker.template.DefaultObjectWrapper default object wrapper} of FreeMarker
automatically wraps Jython nodes with this.

<p>Most of the issues dealing with Jython objects are handled by the 
{@link freemarker.ext.jython.JythonWrapper#wrap(Object)} method. In 
normal cases, this is the only method you should use to turn an 
arbitrary Jython object into a FreeMarker 
{@link freemarker.template.TemplateModel}. Additionally, you can 
manually create instances of any wrapper class using its constructors.
