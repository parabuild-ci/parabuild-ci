/**
 * Represents a {@code null} value; if we get this as the value of a variable from a scope, we do not fall back
 * to a higher scope to get the same variable again. If instead we get a {@code null}, that means that the variable
 * doesn't exist at all in the current scope, and so we fall back to a higher scope. This distinction wasn is only
 * used for (and expected from) certain scopes, so be careful where you are using it. (As of this
 * writing, it's onlt for local variables, including loop variables). The user should never meet a
 * {@link TemplateNullModel}, it must not be returned from public API-s.
